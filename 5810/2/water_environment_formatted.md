# Acid Rain and Fossil Fuels

In this video you will learn that in two quite different ways the burning of fossil fuels can cause our rain to become acidified.  

Sulfuric acid arises from the burning of coal and oil, mainly in power stations, whereas nitric acid arises from the exhaust pipes of our motor vehicles. You will also see some of the effects acid rain has on our environment.

## Natural Acidity of Rain
Rain is naturally slightly acidic. Whilst falling to the ground, the rain dissolves carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to form carbonic acid—a weak acid giving natural rain a pH of 6.  

Burning fossil fuels releases much stronger acids into the rain, forming acid rain with a pH as low as 3.  

Each pH unit = tenfold change in acidity.  
So changing from pH 6 → 3 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000× more acidic.

## How Sulfuric Acid Forms
Plants absorb sulfur from sulfates (e.g., potassium sulfate) in the soil.  
- Sulfur binds to carbon in plant proteins  
- Over millions of years, plants form coal & oil → sulfur remains in fuel  

Burning fossil fuels:  
- Sulfur + carbon → combine with oxygen → carbon dioxide + sulfur dioxide  
- Sunlight → sulfur dioxide + oxygen → sulfur trioxide  
- Sulfur trioxide + rainwater → **sulfuric acid**

## How Nitric Acid Forms
High temperatures in vehicle engines cause nitrogen + oxygen to react.  
- Air is 80% nitrogen  
- Combustion produces nitrogen oxides  
- Nitrogen oxides + oxygen → dissolve in rainwater → **nitric acid**

## Effects on Soil & Living Things
Alkaline (limestone) soils neutralize acidity, but neutral/acid soils & vegetation are damaged:  
- Enzymes needed for growth fail in acidic conditions  
- Example: Bread in vinegar → no mold; bread in water → mold grows  

Acid rain also:  
- Solubilizes toxic metals (e.g., aluminium) → absorbed by plants, replaces essential metals (zinc, iron)  
- Washes away essential ions (potassium, magnesium, calcium) from soil → lowers fertility

# Hard & Soft Water

Rainwater = soft water (no salts).  
Groundwater flows through rocks with calcium salts → hard water.  

Hardness Types:  
- **Temporary**: Calcium hydrogen carbonate → boiling removes hardness → lime scale forms (kettles, pipes, stalactites)  
- **Permanent**: Calcium sulfate → no lime scale but soap scum forms  

Soap: Sodium stearate molecules have:  
- Tail → binds to dirt/oil  
- Head → binds to water  

Calcium stearate = insoluble → forms scum until all calcium removed.  
Detergents: Alkyl benzene sulfonates → calcium salts soluble → no scum problem.

# Water Supply & Treatment

Humans divert water for cities, agriculture, industry.  
- Ancient: Wells, aqueducts  
- Modern: Dams, reservoirs, pipelines  

Stats:  
- 1 in 10 people lack clean water (~700M)  
- Avg Briton: 150 L/day; American: 600 L/day  
- Sub-Saharan Africa: <20 L/day; ⅔ no proper toilets  

Water Sources: Rivers, lakes, aquifers.  

Treatment:  
1. Screening → removes debris  
2. Coagulation (e.g., alum) → particles clump  
3. Sedimentation → settle out solids  
4. Filtration (sand) → removes fine particles  
5. Chlorination → kills bacteria  
6. Fluoridation → strengthens teeth

# Sewage Treatment

⅓ of world lacks safe toilets → disease risk.  
Flush toilets waste clean water → sewage works:  
1. Screens → remove large objects  
2. Sedimentation → solids settle (sludge)  
3. Anaerobic digestion → sludge → methane → energy  
4. Aeration → aerobic bacteria treat water  
5. Trickling filters → microbes clean water  
6. Reed beds → final pathogen removal → water returns to rivers/seas  

Composting toilets:  
- Use aerobic bacteria → produce safe fertilizer → save water & energy

# Water Softening

Soap wasted in hard water → calcium forms scum.  
Solutions:  
- **Washing soda (Na2CO3)** → precipitates calcium as limestone  
- **Boiling** → removes temporary hardness → Ca(HCO3)2 → CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O  
- **Ion exchange resins** → swap calcium for sodium ions → regenerate with brine  

Hardness Testing:  
- Add soap solution from burette → volume needed ∝ hardness

# Acid Rain Solutions

Sources:  
- SO2: Burning fossil fuels (power stations)  
- NOx: Vehicle engines  

Control Methods:  
- **Scrubbers**: Lime (CaO) or seawater neutralizes SO2 → CaSO3 → oxidized → gypsum (CaSO4)  
- **Catalytic converters**: Remove NOx from exhaust gases  

Oil refining: Hydrodesulfurization → removes sulfur before combustion.

# Water Cycle

Water cycle steps:  
1. Evaporation (lakes, rivers, oceans, plants → transpiration, animals → sweat)  
2. Condensation → forms clouds  
3. Precipitation → rain, hail, sleet, snow  
4. Collection → rivers, lakes, oceans, groundwater → cycle repeats

# Water Pollution

Pollution sources:  
- Human sewage → disease (cholera)  
- Fertilizers → eutrophication → algae → oxygen depletion → kills ecosystems  
- Heavy metals → toxic (e.g., Minamata mercury poisoning)  
- Radioactive waste → nuclear accidents (Chernobyl, Fukushima)  
- Plastics → oceans (Great Pacific Garbage Patch)  
- Thermal pollution → warm water from power stations disrupts ecosystems  

Most serious: Human sewage → millions ill/die annually.
