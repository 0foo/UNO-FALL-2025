# Acid Rain – Causes

In this video you will learn that in two quite different ways the burning of fossil fuels can cause our rain to become acidified. Sulfuric acid arises from the burning of coal and oil, mainly in power stations, whereas nitric acid arises from the exhaust pipes of our motor vehicles. You will also see some of the effects acid rain has on our environment.

Firstly it's important to understand that rain is naturally slightly acidic. Whilst falling to the ground the rain dissolves carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to form carbonic acid, a weak acid giving natural rain a pH of 6. It's when we burn fossil fuels that much stronger acids get into our rain, to form acid rain with a pH as low as 3.

When the pH changes from 6 to 3, what do you think the acidity increases by? Two times? Three times?

Ten times? A thousand times? Pause and think.

Remember that each change of one in pH is a tenfold change in acidity, so changing from 6 to 3 is ten times ten times ten or a thousand times more acidic. We'll consider sulfuric acid first. Plants need a little sulfur to grow.

They obtain it from sulfates, for example potassium sulfate, found naturally in the soil. The sulfates are taken up by the plant's roots and sulfur atoms become bonded to carbon atoms in the leaf's proteins. When plants die and eventually form coal and oil over millions of years, these sulfur atoms remain bonded to the carbon atoms.

The sulfur content of coal and oil is usually between one and four percent by weight. What do you think is produced when fossil fuels containing sulfur are burnt? Pause the video whilst you think.

When the coal is burnt, the sulfur and the carbon atoms join with oxygen from the air and are released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. In the presence of sunlight, a photochemical reaction will take place, where sulfur dioxide reacts with more oxygen to form sulfur trioxide. This dissolves in the rainwater, forming sulfuric acid.

Let's now consider how nitric acid gets into the rain. In the high temperature conditions in the cylinders of our motor vehicles, a small amount of nitrogen and oxygen from the air can react. Remember that air taken in to combust the fuel is nearly 80% nitrogen, so exhaust gases from vehicles contain small but significant amounts of nitrogen oxides.

Once the oxides of nitrogen are in the air, they react with more oxygen, just like we saw with sulfur dioxide, and dissolve in the rainwater to form nitric acid. If the rain falls on limestone soils which are alkaline, the acidity may be neutralized. However, if the rain lands on neutral or acid soils, if the rain lands on neutral or acid soils, or on vegetation, then it can cause damage.

So why is this acidity harmful to living things? Well, living things don't grow well in acid conditions, and it's easy to demonstrate this. Soak a slice of bread in vinegar and another in pure water, leave them open for a little while, and then leave them covered for a week.

You will find that the bread soaked in vinegar has not gone mouldy, whereas the other bread has. In fact, we use vinegar to preserve food in a process called pickling. This is the case because certain enzymes which are vital for growth are unable to function in acid conditions.

The other main problem is in the soil. Whilst naturally occurring toxic metals such as aluminium are insoluble, and therefore fairly harmless in neutral soil, they become soluble in acidic soil. They then get taken up by living things and take the place of essential metals such as zinc and iron.

To add to this, the hydrogen ions in the acid rain will replace essential metal ions such as potassium, magnesium and calcium, which are normally held in the clay soil, causing these essential metals to be washed deep into the subsoil away from the roots of plants. So to summarise, normal rain is slightly acidic due to the dissolved carbon dioxide, but acid rain contains sulfuric and nitric acid, making the rain a thousand times more acidic and dangerous for many living things. Sulfuric acid arises from the burning of fossil fuels containing sulphur, nitric acid arises from the combustion of atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen in the high temperature conditions in the cylinders of petrol and diesel engines.

# Hard and Soft Water (full transcript)

If you wash with soap using rainwater, washing is easy and there are plenty of bubbles. We say the water is soft. But if you use well or tap water, it's sometimes difficult to get a lather and the scum forms.

In this case we say the water is hard. Hardness is usually caused by the presence of calcium ions dissolved in the water. Water coming from rivers or wells has had to flow through the surrounding rocks and if they contain soluble calcium salts the water will become hard.

So here's a question. Why do you think rainwater is always soft? Pause the video until you have thought of an answer.

Well, all the salts which dissolve out of the rocks end up in the seas. But when water evaporates, later forming rain, the salts are left behind in the seas, meaning that the rainwater is always free of salts and therefore soft. However, gases from the air can dissolve in rainwater and one of these is dissolved carbon dioxide.

When rainwater falls on limestone, that's calcium carbonate, the limestone dissolves slowly which is how the great caves full of stalactites are formed. Here is the equation. Calcium carbonate reacts with the carbon dioxide in the rain to form soluble calcium hydrogen carbonate.

This form of hardness is called temporary hardness because boiling reverses the reaction and the hardness is removed. But the limestone will deposit in your pipes on the cooking utensils or in your kettle forming something we call lime scale. And this is also how stalactites are formed in those big caves.

Another form of hardness is called permanent hardness which comes from rocks containing gypsum which is calcium sulphate. In this case you do not get lime scale but you still of course get a scum with soap. So what is this scum?

Well, soap is made by boiling natural fats and oils with sodium hydroxide. The soap molecules, for example sodium stearate, have a long tail which is attracted to oil or dirt and the sodium ion end which is attracted to water. In this way dirt is lifted off your hand and the clothes and is carried away by the water.

However, calcium stearate is insoluble so if the water contains calcium ions the soap will not work until all the calcium ions have been precipitated out as scum. Detergents are sodium salts of compounds called alkyl benzene sulfonates whose calcium salts are soluble so there is no problem of scum with detergents. So to summarise, we saw that water becomes hard by flowing through rocks containing calcium salts and these react with soap to form a scum of calcium stearate making it difficult to use the soap.

Temporary hard water forms deposits of lime scale when heated but rain water is soft, lathers easily with soap since it is free of dissolved salts.

# Human Use of Water & Treatment

In this video, we will see how human beings have added to the natural water cycle, you can see that in one of our linked videos, by taking water from rivers for our use in towns and cities. Humans began to interfere with the natural water courses long ago, wells have been dug to access clean water for drinking, the Romans built aqueducts to bring water to their cities, and nowadays we have built dams for irrigation and hydroelectricity and we are taking a huge amount of water from natural sources to use in our homes and industries. Most people in industrialised nations take access to clean water for granted, however more than 1 person in 10, that's over 700 million people, do not have access to clean water and around 3.5 million people die each year from water-related disease.

The average Briton uses 150 litres a day, whilst each American uses 600 litres a day on average. In contrast, many sub-Saharan Africans get less than 20 litres of water a day and two thirds have no proper toilets. For some people, water is a precious and scarce resource.

Only 3% of the water in the world is fresh, of this three quarters is locked up as ice in Antarctica and Greenland and glaciers, nearly another quarter is underground, only 1% is above ground in rivers and lakes. We use the water mainly for irrigation of crops and normally this needs no further purification. The next biggest user is industry, sometimes, for example in food preparation, very clean water is needed.

Finally there is domestic water. Some new housing estates in industrialised countries have a dual water supply, where grey water, collected from rain and effluent from basins, baths and showers, is available for flushing and watering the garden, and the purified water is only used for washing and cooking. Normally only one pipe supplies water to our homes and this water has to be of drinking quality and is purified on an industrial scale at the waterworks.

If you do not have piped water where you live, you might have access to a well. If the well has a brick or concrete wall and sides, the only water able to enter the well will be water that has had to seep through the surrounding rocks, this means that the water is likely to be pure and safe to drink. Piped water from the waterworks, for those lucky enough to have it, originally comes from rivers, lakes, reservoirs or underground aquifers.

The grill will stop large floating objects, fish etc. from entering the waterworks. Next coagulants such as alum are added which causes tiny particles in the water to cluster in lumps which then settle in the sedimentation process.

The filter is made of fine sand to capture any particles that are left. Finally chlorine is added to kill any bacteria. If the water does not naturally contain fluoride ions, they are often added as sodium fluoride as an aid to building strong teeth in those that drink the water.

But for the 700 million people or so without access to clean water, small scale developments are beginning to help. If you are interested in these developments, look up clean drinking water for the world and learn about the LifeStraw, BioSan filters and many more. So to summarise, many people take clean water for granted, it comes in pipes filtered and chlorinated to make it disease free from the waterworks, however there are almost a billion people worldwide who do not yet have access to safe drinking water.

# Sewage Treatment

In this video we trace what happens to human sewage. More than a third of the world's population does not have access to toilets that ensures human waste is kept separate from human contact. In consequence millions of people die every year from waterborne diseases.

Where they do have access to toilets most people have adopted the flush system where clean purified water is used to carry human feces and urine away for treatment. Before we examine what happens at these treatment works let's look at a more sensible way of building a toilet which does not waste so much water but still returns the nutrients back to the soil but without any harmful pathogens. That's microorganisms which cause disease.

A composting toilet does just this. Currently they're used where there is no water supply or sewage disposal but if they replaced the flush system worldwide huge amounts of energy and water would be saved. They work with aerobic bacteria that is those that need oxygen and you end up with the fertilizer that is pathogen free and ready to be returned to the soil.

In flush toilets the human waste is mixed with fresh water and sent down the sewers to the sewage works. The main task is to separate out the waste and the pathogens from the water so clean water can enter the river again. Here are the stages.

First of all screens take out large objects that may have fallen into the sewers. Then the sewage flows slowly to allow grit and gravel to settle. The solids suspended in the water, mostly faeces, settle out in sedimentation tanks and are pumped into anaerobic digesters where bacteria turn some of the carbon into methane which is burnt to provide electricity to drive the pumps and the machinery.

Remaining sludge is dried and normally can be used as a valuable fertilizer. However if industrial waste is diverted into the domestic sewers the sludge may be contaminated by heavy metals and other pollutants and this valuable fertilizer has to be dumped in landfill. The water is still full of pathogenic bacteria and needs further treatment.

First air is bubbled through the water promoting the growth of aerobic bacteria. Then the water trickles over stones where other animals feed on the bacteria. Further sediment tanks capture more sludge and finally the water passes slowly through reed beds where any remaining pathogens are killed by the oxidizing conditions and the water rejoins the river or is pumped out to sea.

So to summarize, less than two-thirds of people on this planet have access to a safe toilet. Most of these use the flush system which is very wasteful of water. This water has to be purified at the sewage works before it can be put back into the rivers and the human waste now free of pathogens can be used to fertilize the land as long as it has not been contaminated by industrial waste.

# Water Softening Methods (version 1)

You learned about hard and soft water in the linked video, Environment 22. Now you will see the two principal ways to soften hard water. Let's start with a soap molecule, sodium stearate.

You will recall that it's difficult to use soap, sodium stearate, with hard water. Instead, you get a scum. If you keep using the soap, the water will eventually soften as the soap reacts with all the calcium ions, forming a scum which floats to the surface as a solid.

Once all the calcium has precipitated, the soap works normally and you'll start to get a lather again. However, this wastes soap, so we need to find something cheaper that will react with the calcium ions in the water and form a precipitate, sort of removing them from the water. Enter washing soda, sodium carbonate.

Much cheaper than soap. When you add the soda, the calcium ions join up with the carbonate ions forming limestone as a precipitate, leaving water free of the hard ions. Now only the sodium ions remain in solution, balancing the sulphate or hydrogen carbonate that used to be with the calcium.

You can remove temporary hardness by boiling the water, as we learnt in the previous unit, but this is expensive and causes lime to deposit on the sides of your container. So here's a question. What is the chemical change that happens when you boil water containing temporary hardness, that is, hardness caused by calcium hydrogen carbonate?

Pause the video whilst you think of your answer. Well, the answer is that the calcium hydrogen carbonate splits up into calcium carbonate, which is the lime scale, carbon dioxide and water. The best way to remove hardness is actually to use something called an ion exchange resin.

These have a fixed anionic lattice, a bit like clay, initially balanced by positive sodium ions. As hard water flows through, the calcium ions are exchanged for the sodium ions so that the calcium ions sort of stick to the clay and the sodium ions come out into the water, and in this way the water is softened because the calcium is no longer there. Obviously, after a time, the resin gets full of calcium ions and you have to reactivate it, and to do this you pour concentrated salt solution, that's sodium chloride solution, very high concentration so that it's high enough to reverse the reaction and the calcium chloride comes out in solution and the column is again full of sodium ions and ready for use.

To compare the hardness of different water samples, you can take a fixed volume, say 25 cc of the hard water, and run soap solution in from a burette, bit by bit, shaking each time until the soap lathers. That means you'll see bubbles on the surface and the more soap solution you have to use, the harder will be the water. To see how water is softened for public water supply, watch Environment 025, Water Treatment.

So to summarise, to soften hard water, you need to remove the calcium ions which are in solution. This is done either by adding washing soda or by using an ion exchange column.

# Acid Rain – Mitigation

Acid rain is a very dilute solution of nitric and sulphuric acids with a pH of around 4. Now we will learn about ways in which we can either make this acid rain less acidic or at the very least reduce its negative effects on our environment. Can you remember where the nitrogen came from in the nitric acid and the sulphur in the sulphuric acid?

Pause and think. Well the nitrogen came from the combination of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen in the cylinders of motor vehicles and the sulphur when fossil fuels containing sulphur are burnt, particularly in our power stations. Let's look at power stations in Europe.

For many years these stations have been using tall chimneys to disperse the sulphur dioxide far away thinking that dilution was the solution to pollution. However the acid did not get diluted but instead was carried in the wind to Scandinavia where it fell into Swedish lakes. Originally people tried to neutralise the acidity by adding limestone to the lakes.

This was partly successful. For example salmon returned to some polluted rivers in Wales after the acidified lakes from which the rivers flowed were treated with lime over a number of years. A much better method is to trap the acid before it reaches the atmosphere in a process called scrubbing.

The kind of scrubber we need in this case is an alkali to react with the sulphur dioxide so either seawater, which contains a little bit of sodium carbonate, or lime, calcium oxide, is used. Can you think what reaction will occur with calcium oxide, a basic oxide, and sulphur dioxide, an acidic oxide? Calcium oxide plus sulphur dioxide makes calcium sulphite, that's CaSO3.

The sulphite can be reacted with oxygen to make gypsum, calcium sulphate, CaSO4, which is the main ingredient of wall plaster. These scrubbers have greatly reduced our sulphur emissions and given many countries much cleaner air, but it does reduce the efficiency of the power station, maybe by as much as 10%, thus increasing the cost of the electricity. In oil refineries sulphur is removed from crude oil by reacting it with hydrogen.

This reaction, known in industry as hydro-desulphurisation, takes place at high temperature with a metal catalyst to produce hydrogen sulphide, that bad egg smell and a very poisonous gas. When this purified oil is refined into various fuels it is virtually free of sulphur. What about reducing the amount of nitric acid in rain?

This time we need to put catalytic converters in the exhaust pipe of all our motor vehicles. Essentially they convert the oxides of nitrogen back into oxygen and nitrogen. It is a pity we have to do this because we use huge amounts of fossil fuel energy getting nitrogen to react with hydrogen to produce nitrogen rich fertilisers.

With a little collector in all the exhaust pipes we could deposit a little pile of fertiliser every time we fill the fuel tank. There's an idea for one of you young entrepreneurs. So to summarise, the best way to reduce the effects of acid rain is to prevent the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen from escaping into the atmosphere in the first place.

This is done by scrubbing the exhaust fumes from power stations using lime or seawater to remove the sulphur dioxide and by fitting catalytic converters to motor vehicle exhausts to decompose the oxides of nitrogen. This is a good way to reduce the effects of acid rain. We can do it by using a little collector in our motor vehicle which we have to put in the exhaust pipe of all our motor vehicles.

It is a pity we have to do this because we use huge amounts of fossil fuel energy getting nitrogen to react with hydrogen to produce nitrogen rich fertilisers. This is done by scrubbing the exhaust fumes from power stations using lime or seawater

# The Water Cycle

When you drink a glass of water, what you may not realise is that the water you're drinking once fell from the sky, possibly any time from a few days to a few years ago, and that the water that fell from the sky was once part of the ocean. In fact, the water that you've just used to quench your thirst may be as old as the earth itself. You might not have realised it, but the amount of water on earth is limited.

It's continually being cycled round in something called the water cycle. The water cycle has a few main parts. They include evaporation, condensation, precipitation and collection.

What sources of water are available for evaporation? This is where water turns from a liquid to a gas. Pause the video and try to name at least four sources.

- Some correct answers include any body of water from a puddle to a pond
- from a pond to a lake
- from lakes to rivers
- and from rivers to seas. All of these act as bodies of water that can be evaporated. The water is turned into a vapour and goes into the air.

An unusual source of water comes from plants. Plants transpire. Essentially, this means lose water from their leaves.

Similarly, animals sweat or perspire. All of these processes cause water to evaporate. Once the water has entered the atmosphere, what do you think happens next?

Pause the video and continue when you think you have an answer. The correct answer is that the water vapour cools and condenses. When it does this, it forms clouds.

You can see this effect for yourself. Take a cold glass of water and place it outside. Water vapour will condense on the outside of the glass.

The water does not leak through. It came from the warm air and is condensed on the outside of the cold glass. Once all of the water is collected in the cloud, you know what happens next.

It falls back down. A fancy word for this is precipitation and it can take many forms. Can you name a few?

Pause the video and continue when you can name at least four forms of precipitation. The correct answers include rain, howl, sleet and snow. For those of you who live in warmer climates, howl is condensed in regular ice crystals.

Sleet is a term used to describe a mixture of snow and rain. Finally, snow is a form of crystallised water. In the end, the water is collected.

It can be collected on land where it either soaks back into the earth, becoming groundwater from which plants and animals can drink, or it may run over the soil, collecting in lakes, oceans and rivers, where you guessed it, the water cycle then repeats. www.globalonenessproject.org

# Water Pollution

Water pollution. In this video we examine the many ways the substances mankind throws away have polluted lakes, rivers and even the oceans. The United Nations estimate that around 10% of the world's people do not have access to clean drinking water, that's over 700 million people.

The main problem with this untreated water is that it can carry diseases such as cholera, spread through untreated human faeces. This is particularly serious in shanty towns near big cities and in refugee camps. Rivers and streams can also be polluted with diseases from water coming from badly managed rubbish dumps.

But human sewage is not the only substance that pollutes our water supplies. Most of the other substances humans allow to escape into streams, rivers and the oceans are more a danger to natural ecosystems than to us directly. Chemical fertilizers are much more soluble in water than organic manure based fertilizers, so heavy rain can wash them into streams and lakes, causing eutrophication.

The fertilizers cause algae to grow very fast, forming a mat on the lake surface. This blocks sunlight from the vegetation deeper down, which dies. Bacteria then feed off the dying vegetation and use up the remaining oxygen supply.

Once the oxygen has gone, all animal life dies, the lake ecosystem is destroyed. If heavy metals such as lead, mercury and cadmium get into rivers and lakes, many animals will die. In Minamata, Japan, a polluting mercury fungicide factory was closed in 1968, yet people there have continued to be affected by the mercury poisoning, the so-called Minamata disease, ever since, because the fish, caught locally in the bay, still have traces of mercury in them.

Nowadays, the use of mercury and cadmium in fungicides has been largely replaced by copper and organic compounds. The removal of lead from petrol began in the 70s when it became clear that lead poisoning, causing mental defects, was caused, at least in part, by the lead compounds added to petrol to make it burn more smoothly. It has taken 40 years since then for a United Nations global ban on the sale of leaded petrol.

The last six nations complied in 2013. Radioactive waste is normally stored above ground in water tanks, waiting for more permanent underground storage, where it has to be safe for millions of years. There are fears that these underground stores could fail and contaminate watercourses.

Currently, small amounts of radioactive material are allowed to be washed out to sea, on the basis that it will become so diluted that it will make no difference to the natural background radioactivity in the oceans. Following a nuclear disaster, like Five Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, or Fukushima in 2011, watercourses and the oceans can become dangerously polluted with radioactive waste. During mining and drilling operations to extract minerals from the earth, aquifers, which are the underground watercourses, can become polluted.

Huge amounts of plastic, thrown away from ships and washed out to sea from rubbish dumps on land, have ended up floating in huge islands of waste, causing a serious threat to fish, seabirds and other marine animals. The so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch is estimated to be half the size of Europe, and there are four others. Coal and oil-fuelled power stations have been responsible, more so in the past, for causing acid rain, which devastated many North European lakes in the 60s.

See our video on acid rain for more on this. Fossil fuel and nuclear power stations need large amounts of water for condensing the steam which drives their turbines. This water is usually cooled on site in the great cooling towers that dominate the skyline of power stations.

Even so, the water will be returned to the river or sea warmer than before, and this can upset the river or sea ecosystems. Although not material pollution, this waste heat is a pollutant. So, to summarise, there are many ways mankind is polluting the rivers, lakes and seas.

Perhaps the most serious, causing millions to become ill or die, is pollution by human sewage. To learn how we are attempting to purify wastewater and to make water fit to drink, see our linked video, Water Treatment. www.globalonenessproject.org
