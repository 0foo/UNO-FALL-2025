In this video, we trace what happens to human sewage. More than a third of the world's population does not have access to toilets that ensure human waste is kept separate from human contact. In consequence, millions of people die every year from waterborne diseases.

Where they do have access to toilets, most people have adopted the flush system, where clean, purified water is used to carry human feces and urine away for treatment. Before we examine what happens at these treatment works, let's look at a more sensible way of building a toilet which does not waste so much water but still returns the nutrients back to the soil but without any harmful pathogens. That's microorganisms which cause disease.

A composting toilet does just this. Currently, they're used where there is no water supply or sewage disposal. But if they replaced the flush system worldwide, huge amounts of energy and water would be saved. They work with aerobic bacteria, that is those that need oxygen, and you end up with the fertilizer that is pathogen-free and ready to be returned to the soil.

In flush toilets, the human waste is mixed with fresh water and sent down the sewers to the sewage works. The main task is to separate out the waste and the pathogens from the water so clean water can enter the river again.

Here are the stages.
* First of all, screens take out large objects that may have fallen into the sewers.
* Then the sewage flows slowly to allow grit and gravel to settle.
* The solids suspended in the water, mostly feces, settle out in sedimentation tanks, and are pumped into anaerobic digesters where bacteria turn some of the carbon into methane, which is burnt to provide electricity to drive the pumps and the machinery.
* Remaining sludge is dried and normally can be used as a valuable fertilizer. However, if industrial waste is diverted into the domestic sewers, the sludge may be contaminated by heavy metals and other pollutants, and this valuable fertilizer has to be dumped in landfill.

The water is still full of pathogenic bacteria and needs further treatment.
* First, air is bubbled through the water, promoting the growth of aerobic bacteria.
* Then, the water trickles over stones where other animals feed on the bacteria.
* Further sediment tanks capture more sludge.
* Finally, the water passes slowly through reed beds where any remaining pathogens are killed by the oxidizing conditions and the water rejoins the river or is pumped out to sea.

So to summarize less than 2/3 of people on this planet have access to a safe toilet. Most of these use the flush system which is very wasteful of water. This water has to be purified at the sewage works before it can be put back into the rivers. And the human waste, now free of pathogens, can be used to fertilize the land as long as it has not been contaminated by industrial waste.

When you drink a glass of water what you may not realize is that the water you're drinking once fell from the sky possibly any time from a few days to a few years ago and that the water that fell from the sky was once part of the ocean. In fact the water that you've just used to quench your thirst may be as old as the Earth itself.

You might not have realized it but the amount of water on Earth is limited. It's continually being cycled around in something called the water cycle. The water cycle has a few main parts. They include:
* Evaporation
* Condensation
* Precipitation
* Collection

What sources of water are available for evaporation? This is where water turns from a liquid to a gas. Pause and try to name at least four sources.

Some correct answers include any body of water from a puddle to a pond, from a pond to a lake, from lakes to rivers, and from rivers to seas. All of these act as bodies of water that can be evaporated. The water is turned into a vapor and goes into the air. An unusual source of water comes from plants. Plants transpire; essentially this means lose water from their leaves. Similarly animals sweat or perspire. All of these processes cause water to evaporate.

Once the water has entered the atmosphere what happens next? Pause and continue when you think you have an answer.

The correct answer is that the water vapor cools and condenses. When it does this it forms clouds. You can see this effect for yourself: take a cold glass of water and place it outside. Water vapor will condense on the outside of the glass. The water does not leak through; it came from the warm air and condensed on the outside of the cold glass.

Once all of the water is collected in the cloud, it falls back down. A fancy word for this is precipitation and it can take many forms. Can you name a few? Pause and continue when you can name at least four forms of precipitation.

The correct answers include rain, hail, sleet, and snow. For those in warmer climates hail is condensed irregular ice crystals. Sleet is a mixture of snow and rain. Snow is crystallized water.

In the end the water is collected. It can be collected on land where it either soaks back into the Earth becoming groundwater from which plants and animals can drink or it may run over the soil collecting in lakes, oceans, and rivers where the water cycle then repeats.

If you wash with soap using rain water washing is easy and there are plenty of bubbles. We say the water is soft. But if you use well or tap water it's sometimes difficult to get a lather and scum forms. In this case we say the water is hard. Hardness is usually caused by the presence of calcium ions dissolved in the water. Water coming from rivers or wells has had to flow through the surrounding rocks and if they contain soluble calcium salts the water will become hard.

Why is rainwater always soft? Well all the salts which dissolve out of the rocks end up in the seas. But when water evaporates later forming the rain the salts are left behind in the seas meaning that the rain water is always free of salts and therefore soft.

However gases from the air can dissolve in rain water and one of these is dissolved carbon dioxide. When rain water falls on limestone (that's calcium carbonate) the limestone dissolves slowly which is how the great caves full of stalactites formed.

Here is the equation: calcium carbonate reacts with carbon dioxide in the rain to form soluble calcium hydrogen carbonate. This form of hardness is called temporary hardness because boiling reverses the reaction and the hardness is removed. But the limestone will deposit in your pipes on the cooking utensils or in your kettle forming something we call lime scale and this is also how stalactites are formed in those big caves.

Another form of hardness is called permanent hardness which comes from rocks containing gypsum which is calcium sulfate. In this case you do not get lime scale but you still get a scum with soap.

What is this scum? Soap is made by boiling natural fats and oils with sodium hydroxide. The soap molecules (for example sodium stearate) have a long tail which is attracted to oil or dirt and the sodium ion end which is attracted to water. In this way dirt is lifted off your hand and the clothes and is carried away by the water. However calcium stearate is insoluble so if the water contains calcium ions the soap will not work until all the calcium ions have been precipitated out as scum.

Detergents are sodium salts of compounds called alkyl benzene sulfonates whose calcium salts are soluble so there is no problem of scum with detergents.

So to summarize:
* Water becomes hard by flowing through rocks containing calcium salts.
* These react with soap to form a scum of calcium stearate making it difficult to use the soap.
* Temporary hard water forms deposits of lime scale when heated.
* Rainwater is soft and lathers easily with soap since it's free of dissolved salts.

Humans have added to the natural water cycle by taking water from rivers for our use in towns and cities. Wells have been dug to access clean water for drinking. The Romans built aqueducts to bring water to their cities. Nowadays we've built dams for irrigation and hydroelectricity and we're taking a huge amount of water from natural sources to use in our homes and industries.

Most people in industrialized nations take access to clean water for granted. However more than one person in 10 (that's over 700 million people) do not have access to clean water and around three and a half million people die each year from water-related disease.

The average Briton uses 150 liters a day whilst each American uses 600 liters a day on average. In contrast many sub-Saharan Africans get less than 20 liters of water a day and two-thirds have no proper toilets. For some people water is a precious and scarce resource.

Only three percent of the water in the world is fresh. Of this, three quarters is locked up as ice in Antarctica, Greenland, and glaciers. Nearly another quarter is underground. Only one percent is above ground in rivers and lakes.

We use the water mainly for irrigation of crops (normally this needs no further purification). The next biggest user is industry. Sometimes, for example in food preparation, very clean water is needed. Finally there is domestic water.

Some new housing estates in industrialized countries have a dual water supply where grey water collected from rain and from effluent from basins, baths, and showers is available for flushing and watering the garden. Purified water is only used for washing and cooking. However normally only one pipe supplies water to our homes and this water has to be of drinking quality and is purified on an industrial scale at the waterworks.

If you do not have piped water you might have access to a well. If the well has a brick or concrete wall and sides, the only water able to enter the well will be water that has had to seep through the surrounding rocks. This means the water is likely to be pure and safe to drink.

Piped water from the waterworks originally comes from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, or underground aquifers. The grill stops large floating objects (fish etc.) from entering the waterworks. Next coagulants such as alum are added which causes tiny particles in the water to cluster in lumps which then settle in the sedimentation process. The filter is made of fine sand to capture any particles that are left. Finally chlorine is added to kill any bacteria. If the water does not naturally contain fluoride ions they are often added as sodium fluoride as an aid to building strong teeth in those that drink the water.

But for the 700 million people without access to clean water, small-scale developments are beginning to help. If you are interested in these developments look up clean drinking water for the world and learn about the life straw, biosand filters, and many more.

So to summarize:
* Many people take clean water for granted.
* It comes in pipes filtered and chlorinated to make it disease-free from the waterworks.
* Almost a billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water.



# What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/Zk1J2EW-nmQ

Water pollution has many causes. Around 10 percent of the world's people (over 700 million) do not have access to clean drinking water. The main problem with untreated water is that it can carry diseases such as cholera spread through untreated human feces. This is particularly serious in shanty towns near big cities and in refugee camps.

Rivers and streams can also be polluted with diseases from water coming from badly managed rubbish dumps. But human sewage is not the only substance that pollutes our water supplies. Most of the other substances humans allow to escape into streams, rivers, and the oceans are more a danger to natural ecosystems than to us directly.

Chemical fertilizers are much more soluble in water than organic manure-based fertilizers so heavy rain can wash them into streams and lakes causing eutrophication. The fertilizers cause algae to grow very fast forming a mat on the lake surface. This blocks sunlight from the vegetation deeper down which dies. Bacteria then feed off the dying vegetation and use up the remaining oxygen supply. Once the oxygen has gone all animal life dies. The lake ecosystem is destroyed.

If heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and cadmium get into rivers and lakes many animals will die. In Minamata, Japan a polluting mercury fungicide factory was closed in 1968 yet people there have continued to be affected by the mercury poisoning (the so-called Minamata disease) ever since because the fish caught locally in the bay still have traces of mercury in them.

Nowadays the use of mercury and cadmium in fungicides has been largely replaced by copper and organic compounds. The removal of lead from petrol began in the 70s when it became clear that lead poisoning causing mental defects was at least partly due to lead compounds added to petrol to make it burn more smoothly. It has taken 40 years since then for a United Nations global ban on the sale of leaded petrol; the last six nations complied in 2013.

Radioactive waste is normally stored above ground in water tanks waiting for permanent underground storage where it has to be safe for millions of years. There are fears that these underground stores could fail and contaminate watercourses. Small amounts of radioactive material are allowed to be washed out to sea on the basis that it will become so diluted that it will make no difference to the natural background radioactivity in the oceans. Following nuclear disasters like Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986), or Fukushima (2011), watercourses and oceans can become dangerously polluted with radioactive waste.

During mining and drilling operations to extract minerals, aquifers (underground watercourses) can become polluted. Huge amounts of plastic thrown away from ships and washed out to sea from rubbish dumps on land have ended up floating in huge islands of waste causing a serious threat to fish, seabirds, and other marine animals. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is estimated to be half the size of Europe and there are four others.

Coal and oil-fueled power stations have been responsible for causing acid rain which devastated many North European lakes in the 60s. Fossil fuel and nuclear power stations need large amounts of water for condensing the steam which drives their turbines. This water is usually cooled on site in great cooling towers. Even so the water will be returned to the river or sea warmer than before and this can upset the river or sea ecosystems. Although not material pollution this waste heat is a pollutant.

So to summarize:
* Many ways exist for mankind to pollute rivers, lakes, and seas.
* The most serious causing millions to become ill or die is pollution by human sewage.
* Other pollutants include fertilizers, heavy metals, radioactive waste, plastics, and thermal pollution.
