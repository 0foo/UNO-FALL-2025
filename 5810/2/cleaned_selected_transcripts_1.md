In this video, we trace what happens to human sewage. More than a third of the world's population does not have access to toilets that ensure human waste is kept separate from human contact. In consequence, millions of people die every year from waterborne diseases.

Where they do have access to toilets, most people have adopted the flush system, where clean, purified water is used to carry human feces and urine away for treatment. Before we examine what happens at these treatment works, let's look at a more sensible way of building a toilet which does not waste so much water but still returns the nutrients back to the soil but without any harmful pathogens. That's microorganisms which cause disease.

A composting toilet does just this. Currently, they're used where there is no water supply or sewage disposal. But if they replaced the flush system worldwide, huge amounts of energy and water would be saved. They work with aerobic bacteria, that is those that need oxygen, and you end up with the fertilizer that is pathogen-free and ready to be returned to the soil.

In flush toilets, the human waste is mixed with fresh water and sent down the sewers to the sewage works. The main task is to separate out the waste and the pathogens from the water so clean water can enter the river again.

Here are the stages:
* First of all, screens take out large objects that may have fallen into the sewers.
* Then the sewage flows slowly to allow grit and gravel to settle.
* The solids suspended in the water, mostly feces, settle out in sedimentation tanks, and are pumped into anaerobic digesters where bacteria turn some of the carbon into methane, which is burnt to provide electricity to drive the pumps and the machinery.
* Remaining sludge is dried and normally can be used as a valuable fertilizer. However, if industrial waste is diverted into the domestic sewers, the sludge may be contaminated by heavy metals and other pollutants, and this valuable fertilizer has to be dumped in landfill.

The water is still full of pathogenic bacteria and needs further treatment:
* First, air is bubbled through the water, promoting the growth of aerobic bacteria.
* Then, the water trickles over stones where other animals feed on the bacteria.
* Further sediment tanks capture more sludge.
* Finally, the water passes slowly through reed beds where any remaining pathogens are killed by the oxidizing conditions and the water rejoins the river or is pumped out to sea.

So to summarize less than 2/3 of people on this planet have access to a safe toilet. Most of these use the flush system which is very wasteful of water. This water has to be purified at the sewage works before it can be put back into the rivers. And the human waste, now free of pathogens, can be used to fertilize the land as long as it has not been contaminated by industrial waste.

When you drink a glass of water what you may not realize is that the water you're drinking once fell from the sky possibly any time from a few days to a few years ago and that the water that fell from the sky was once part of the ocean. In fact the water that you've just used to quench your thirst may be as old as the Earth itself.

You might not have realized it but the amount of water on Earth is limited. It's continually being cycled around in something called the water cycle. The water cycle has a few main parts. They include:
* Evaporation
* Condensation
* Precipitation
* Collection

What sources of water are available for evaporation? This is where water turns from a liquid to a gas. Pause and try to name at least four sources.

Some correct answers include any body of water from a puddle to a pond, from a pond to a lake, from lakes to rivers, and from rivers to seas. All of these act as bodies of water that can be evaporated. The water is turned into a vapor and goes into the air. An unusual source of water comes from plants. Plants transpire; essentially this means lose water from their leaves. Similarly animals sweat or perspire. All of these processes cause water to evaporate.

Once the water has entered the atmosphere what happens next? Pause and continue when you think you have an answer.

The correct answer is that the water vapor cools and condenses. When it does this it forms clouds. You can see this effect for yourself: take a cold glass of water and place it outside. Water vapor will condense on the outside of the glass. The water did not leak through; it came from the warm air and condensed on the outside of the cold glass.

Once all of the water is collected in the cloud, it falls back down. A fancy word for this is precipitation and it can take many forms. Can you name a few? Pause and continue when you can name at least four forms of precipitation.

The correct answers include rain, hail, sleet, and snow. For those in warmer climates hail is condensed irregular ice crystals. Sleet is a mixture of snow and rain. Snow is crystallized water.

In the end the water is collected. It can be collected on land where it either soaks back into the Earth becoming groundwater from which plants and animals can drink or it may run over the soil collecting in lakes, oceans, and rivers where the water cycle then repeats.

If you wash with soap using rain water washing is easy and there are plenty of bubbles. We say the water is soft. But if you use well or tap water it's sometimes difficult to get a lather and a scum forms. In this case we say the water is hard. Hardness is usually caused by the presence of calcium ions dissolved in the water. Water coming from rivers or wells has had to flow through the surrounding rocks and if they contain soluble calcium salts the water will become hard.

So here's a question: why do you think rainwater is always soft? Pause the video until you have thought of an answer.

Well all the salts which dissolve out of the rocks end up in the seas. But when water evaporates later forming the rain the salts are left behind in the seas meaning that the rain water is always free of salts and therefore soft.

However gases from the air can dissolve in rain water and one of these is dissolved carbon dioxide. When rain water falls on limestone (that's calcium carbonate) the limestone dissolves slowly which is how the great caves full of stalactites formed.

Here is the equation:
* Calcium carbonate reacts with carbon dioxide in the rain to form soluble calcium hydrogen carbonate.

This form of hardness is called temporary hardness because boiling reverses the reaction and the hardness is removed. But the limestone will deposit in your pipes on the cooking utensils or in your kettle forming something we call lime scale and this is also how stalactites are formed in those big caves.

Another form of hardness is called permanent hardness which comes from rocks containing gypsum which is calcium sulfate. In this case you do not get lime scale but you still of course get a scum with soap.

What is this scum? Soap is made by boiling natural fats and oils with sodium hydroxide. The soap molecules for example sodium stearate have a long tail which is attracted to oil or dirt and the sodium ion end which is attracted to water. In this way dirt is lifted off your hand and the clothes and is carried away by the water. However calcium stearate is insoluble so if the water contains calcium ions the soap will not work until all the calcium ions have been precipitated out as scum.

Detergents are sodium salts of compounds called alkyl benzene sulfonates whose calcium salts are soluble so there is no problem of scum with detergents.

So to summarize:
* Water becomes hard by flowing through rocks containing calcium salts.
* These react with soap to form a scum of calcium stearate making it difficult to use the soap.
* Temporary hard water forms deposits of lime scale when heated.
* Rainwater is soft and lathers easily with soap since it's free of dissolved salts.


# Softening Hard Water
# Combined from https://www.youtube.com/watch/w7tUZIVz5LE and https://www.youtube.com/watch/5C-yyZfDhl8

Let's start with a soap molecule: sodium stearate.

Using soap like sodium stearate with hard water is difficult because the calcium ions in the water react with the soap, forming a scum. If you keep adding soap, the calcium eventually precipitates out, the water softens, and the soap lathers normally—but this wastes soap.

A cheaper approach is to add washing soda (sodium carbonate). When added, the calcium ions react with the carbonate ions, forming insoluble calcium carbonate (limestone) and leaving the water free of hard ions. Now only the sodium ions remain in solution, balancing the sulfate or hydrogen carbonate that was with the calcium.

Temporary hardness, caused by calcium hydrogen carbonate, can be removed by boiling:
* Calcium hydrogen carbonate → calcium carbonate (lime scale) + carbon dioxide + water
* Boiling removes hardness but leaves lime scale deposits on containers.

The best method is to use an ion exchange resin:
* The resin contains a fixed anionic lattice initially balanced by sodium ions.
* As hard water flows through, calcium ions are exchanged for sodium ions.
* Calcium ions stick to the resin; sodium ions go into the water.
* The water is softened because the calcium is removed.

Reactivating the resin:
* Pass concentrated sodium chloride solution through the column.
* The high salt concentration replaces the calcium ions with sodium ions.
* Calcium chloride comes out in solution; the resin is ready for use again.

Testing hardness of water:
* Take a fixed volume (e.g., 25 cc) of the water sample.
* Add soap solution bit by bit, shaking each time until a lather forms.
* The more soap needed, the harder the water.

As hard water flows through:  
* Calcium ions are exchanged for sodium ions.  
* The calcium ions stick to the resin, and the sodium ions go into the water.  
* The water is softened because the calcium is no longer there.  

After a time, the resin fills with calcium ions and must be reactivated.  
* Pour concentrated salt solution (sodium chloride) through the column.  
* The high concentration reverses the reaction, and calcium chloride comes out in solution.  
* The column is again full of sodium ions and ready for use.  

To compare the hardness of different water samples:  
* Take a fixed volume (e.g., 25 cc) of the hard water.  
* Add soap solution bit by bit, shaking each time until the soap lathers.  
* The more soap needed, the harder the water.  

So to summarize:  
* To soften hard water, remove the calcium ions in solution.  
* This is done by adding washing soda or using an ion exchange column.


Summary:
* Hardness comes from calcium ions in the water.
* You can remove it by:
  * Adding washing soda
  * Boiling (for temporary hardness)
  * Using an ion exchange column (best method)

In this video we will see how human beings have added to the natural water cycle. You can see that in one of our linked videos.

By taking water from rivers for our use in towns and cities, humans began to interfere with the natural watercourses long ago. Wells have been dug to access clean water for drinking. The Romans built aqueducts to bring water to their cities, and nowadays we've built dams for irrigation and hydroelectricity. We're taking a huge amount of water from natural sources to use in our homes and industries.

Most people in industrialized nations take access to clean water for granted. However, more than one person in ten — that's over 700 million people — do not have access to clean water, and around three and a half million people die each year from water-related disease.

The average Briton uses 150 liters a day, while each American uses 600 liters a day on average. In contrast, many sub-Saharan Africans get less than 20 liters of water a day, and two-thirds have no proper toilets. For some people water is a precious and scarce resource.

Only three percent of the water in the world is fresh. Of this, three-quarters is locked up as ice in Antarctica, Greenland, and glaciers. Nearly another quarter is underground, and only one percent is above ground in rivers and lakes.

We use the water mainly for irrigation of crops, which normally needs no further purification. The next biggest user is industry — sometimes, for example in food preparation, very clean water is needed. Finally, there is domestic water. Some new housing estates in industrialized countries have a dual water supply where grey water collected from rain and from effluent from basins, baths, and showers is available for flushing and watering the garden, while purified water is only used for washing and cooking.

However, normally only one pipe supplies water to our homes, and this water has to be of drinking quality and is purified on an industrial scale at the waterworks.

If you do not have piped water where you live, you might have access to a well. If the well has a brick or concrete wall and sides, the only water able to enter the well will be water that has seeped through the surrounding rocks. This means that the water is likely to be pure and safe to drink.

Piped water from the waterworks for those lucky enough to have it originally comes from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, or underground aquifers. The grill stops large floating objects — fish, etc. — from entering the waterworks. Next, coagulants such as alum are added, causing tiny particles in the water to cluster in lumps which then settle in the sedimentation process. The filter is made of fine sand to capture any particles that are left. Finally, chlorine is added to kill any bacteria. If the water does not naturally contain fluoride ions, they are often added as sodium fluoride to help build strong teeth in those who drink the water.

For the 700 million people without access to clean water, small-scale developments are beginning to help. If you are interested in these developments, look up clean drinking water for the world and learn about the LifeStraw, biosand filters, and many more.

So to summarize, many people take clean water for granted. It comes in pipes, filtered and chlorinated to make it disease-free from the waterworks. However, there are almost a billion people worldwide who do not yet have access to safe drinking water.

Where toilets are available, most people use the flush system, where clean, purified water carries human feces and urine away for treatment. Before looking at what happens at treatment works, let's look at a more sensible toilet design that does not waste so much water, still returns the nutrients to the soil, but without harmful pathogens (microorganisms that cause disease).

A composting toilet does this:
* Used where there is no water supply or sewage disposal.
* If adopted worldwide, would save huge amounts of energy and water.
* Works with aerobic bacteria (need oxygen) to produce pathogen-free fertilizer ready to return to the soil.

In flush toilets, human waste is mixed with fresh water and sent down sewers to sewage works. The main task is separating out waste and pathogens so clean water can return to rivers.

Stages of treatment:
* Screens remove large objects.
* Sewage flows slowly so grit and gravel settle.
* Solids (mostly feces) settle in sedimentation tanks.
* Solids go to anaerobic digesters where bacteria turn some carbon into methane, burned to power pumps and machinery.
* Remaining sludge is dried and can be used as fertilizer unless contaminated by industrial waste (e.g., heavy metals), in which case it goes to landfill.

Further water treatment:
* Air bubbled through water promotes aerobic bacteria growth.
* Water trickles over stones where animals feed on bacteria.
* More sludge settles in sediment tanks.
* Water passes through reed beds where remaining pathogens die from oxidizing conditions.
* Water rejoins the river or is pumped to the sea.

Summary:
* Less than two-thirds of people have access to a safe toilet.
* Most use flush systems that waste water.
* Water must be purified before returning to rivers.
* Human waste, once pathogen-free, can fertilize land unless contaminated by industrial waste.
