* Summary of Limestone Uses  
    * Building material for structures and monuments.  
    * Production of cement, mortar, concrete, and aggregates.  
    * Glass manufacturing.  
    * Neutralizing acidic environments (liming).  
    * Source of lime products (quicklime, slaked lime).  
    * Additive in paints, plastics, and toothpaste.  
    * Role in hard water and limescale formation.  
    * testing for CO2
* acid rain
    * contains acids that are water soluble that cause erosion of limestone structures

* what is an ore vs mineral
* A more reactive element can displace a less reactive element from its compound in a **single displacement reaction**.  

* bioleaching 
* phytomining

### Rocks
* Rock Cycle 
    * Magma 
        * molten rock in the mantle
    * Igneous
        * molten rock cools and forms Igneous rock
        * Igneous rocks form from cooling Magma (e.g., granite, basalt).  
    * Sedimentary
        * Weathering and erosion → Sedimentary rocks form (e.g., sandstone, limestone).
    * Metamorphic Rock Formation  
        * Rocks buried under heat and pressure change form (metamorphosis).  
        * Examples:  
            * Sandstone → Quartzite  
            * Clay → Shale → Slate  
            * Limestone → Marble  
    * all these can change forms between each other
        * Igneous become Metamorphic become Magma
        * Igneous become Magma
        * Igneous become Sedimentary become Magma
        * etc. etc. etc.

 
* Sandstone
    * Forms from sand grains deposited by rivers and seas.  
    * Has rounded grains with air spaces, making it porous and able to hold water. 
* Basalt: Denser, magnesium- and iron-rich, forming the oceanic crust.  
* Granite: Less dense, aluminum- and silica-rich, forming the continents.  
    * Forms when molten rock (magma) cools and solidifies underground.  
    * Has interlocking grains, making it dense and impermeable (no air spaces). 
* Limestone
    * Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).  
    * Formed millions of years ago from the compressed shells and skeletons of dead marine organisms deposited on the seabed.  
* Sandstone + heat/pressure → Quartzite  
* Clay + heat/pressure → Shale → Slate  
* Limestone + heat/pressure → Marble 
* Coal forms from plant matter (peat) compressed over millions of years.
* Examples of ores:  
    * Hematite (iron ore) → high in iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃).  
    * Malachite (copper ore) → high in copper(II) carbonate (CuCO₃).  
    * Cinnabar (mercury ore) → high in mercury(II) sulfide (HgS).  
    * Limestone → high in calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).  
    * Most ores contain metals combined as:  
    * Oxides (e.g., Fe₂O₃ in hematite)  
    * Carbonates (e.g., CuCO₃ in malachite)  
    * Sulfides (e.g., HgS in cinnabar)  
    * Some nonmetal ores exist too, e.g., quartz (SiO₂) for silicon.  
* Metals like gold (Au) and platinum (Pt) occur naturally in metallic form.  
    * They are very low in the reactivity series, so they do not combine with oxygen, sulfur, or carbon in the crust.  
    * typically form veins in rocks

### Plate Tectonics and rock cycle
* **Inner Core:**  
    * Solid iron-nickel alloy.  
    * Extremely hot (~5,700°C), but high pressure keeps it solid.  
* **Outer Core:**  
    * Molten iron-nickel layer surrounding the inner core.  
    * Movement of liquid metal creates Earth’s magnetic field (geodynamo).  
* **Mantle:**  
    * Solid but behaves plastically, meaning it can flow very slowly over millions of years.  
    * Composed mainly of aluminum- and magnesium-rich silicate rocks.  
    * Convection currents in the mantle drive plate tectonics and continental drift.  
* **Crust:**  
    * Outer solid layer of the Earth, made of two main types of rock:  
        * Basalt: Denser, magnesium- and iron-rich, forming the oceanic crust.  
        * Granite: Less dense, aluminum- and silica-rich, forming the continents.  
    * Continents “float” on the denser mantle below, like icebergs in water. 
* Lithosphere: Crust + very top part of the mantle; rigid and brittle.
* Asthenosphere: The layer just below the lithosphere in the upper mantle; it’s solid rock but soft and plastic-like because it’s so hot—it can flow slowly.
* Lower Mantle: Beneath the asthenosphere, rock is solid but hotter and under more pressure, so it behaves differently.
* lithosphere (crust + upper mantle) divided into large tectonic plate
* rides around on top of the asthenosphere
* Convection currents in the asthenosphere drive plate tectonics, causing earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building.
    * When rock deep in the mantle heats up, it becomes less dense and rises slowly toward the surface.
    * As it moves away from the heat source, it cools, becomes denser, and sinks back down.
    * This rising and sinking sets up a loop-like flow called a convection current
    * Where mantle rises: mid-ocean ridges form, creating new crust.
    * Where mantle sinks: subduction zones form, pulling plates down.

* divergent boundaries
* convergent boundaries
* transform boundaries
