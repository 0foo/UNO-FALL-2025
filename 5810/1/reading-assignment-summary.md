### Reading notes

* Environmental chemistry is the study of sources, reactions, transport, and fate of chemical entities in the air, water, and soil environments, as well as their effects on human health and the natural environment.
	* pollution
	* nature of chemicals in natural environment
	* lifes existence due to environmental chemistry

* Environmental chemistry is probably the most interdisciplinary of the many branches of chemistry.
	* ocean
	* organic, inorganic, analytical, physical, biology, toxicology, ecology, etc.


* 4 parts to environmental chemistry
	* characteristics of molecule
	* physical chemical properties of the compound
	* transformations/distribution in environment
	* bioogical effects
	
* * The basic characteristics of the molecule itself are the starting point for understanding the environmental chemistry of chemicals.
	* govern the physical-chemical properties of the compound, such as its aqueous solubility and vapor pressure
	* distribution in environment, transformation, and some biological properties
	* can predict effects, environmental response
	* allows some sense of organization of this field rather than chaos





### Summary
* 1.1 Alchemy and Early Chemistry
* Ancient Roots: Greeks explored matter philosophically; Egyptians mastered applied chemistry (embalming, dyes, metallurgy).
* Alchemy: From al-kimiya, focused on metal transmutation (lead → gold), steeped in mysticism, religion, and symbols (e.g., gold = sun, silver = moon).
* Key Figures:
* Agricola (1494–1555): De Re Metallica compiled practical metallurgy knowledge.
* Libavius (1540–1616): Alchemia (1597) removed mysticism, clear scientific writing.
* Paracelsus (1493–1541): Advocated chemical medicines → roots of chemotherapy.
* Boyle (1627–1691): The Sceptical Chymist (1661) ended alchemy’s dominance; introduced rational scientific methods, Boyle’s Law, modern “chemistry.”
* Lavoisier (1743–1794): Air composition, oxygen use by animals, CO₂ release; Elementary Book of Chemistry (1789) → start of modern chemistry.

* 1.2 The Chemical Age
* 19th-Century Advances: Molecular structure studies, organic synthesis, reaction pathways established modern chemistry foundations.
* William Perkin (1838–1907): Founded synthetic dye industry (aniline purple); first chemical industry from lab research → led to modern synthetic chemical industry.
* Fritz Haber (1868–1934): Haber Process (N₂ + H₂ → NH₃) → fertilizers enabled large-scale food production → supported population growth, major environmental impact.
* Industrial Growth: Plastics, pesticides, drugs, petroleum products, fertilizers expanded rapidly; Chemical Age followed Stone, Bronze, Industrial, Atomic Ages.

* 1.3 Emergence of Environmental Chemistry
* Early Concerns: Thames River pollution → Royal Commission (1885) introduced BOD test (still used) for water quality.
* Ocean/Freshwater Chemistry: HMS Challenger (1872) → seawater composition; limnology linked C, O, N, P cycles to ecosystems.
* Modern Era Milestones:
* 1962: Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring → global awareness of chemical residues.
* 1952: Synge & Martin Nobel Prize for chromatography → trace chemical detection; flame ionization & electron capture detectors extended sensitivity.
* 1960s–1980s: Data on residues → theory for distribution, transport, transformation; partition & fugacity concepts explained chemical behavior.
* Today: Greenhouse gases, carbon cycle modeling, toxicity & ecosystem health studies dominate environmental chemistry research.

* 1.4 Scope of Environmental Chemistry
* Definition: Study of sources, reactions, transport, fate, and effects of chemicals in air, water, and soil on human health & ecosystems.
* Key Areas:
* Abiotic Systems: Atmospheric, oceanic, soil, limnological chemistry.
* Natural Ecosystems: Chemical ecology, pheromones, allelochemistry.
* Hazardous Chemicals: Modeling transport, degradation, waste disposal.
* Toxic Effects: Environmental toxicology, QSARs, human health impacts.
* Origins of Life: Chemical evolution → biomolecules → early life forms.
* Environmental chemistry merges organic, inorganic, physical, and analytical chemistry with biology, toxicology, public health, and ecology.

* 1.5 Environmental Management
* Applications:
* Set discharge standards, monitor pollutants in air, water, soil, and biota.
* Regulate new chemicals before release.
* Manage industrial emissions & waste disposal.
* Government & Industry Roles: Worker safety testing, emissions monitoring, contamination cleanup, chemical risk assessment.
* Future Needs: Cleaner production, safer chemical design, improved regulation, public risk communication.

* 1.6 Core Concept of the Book
* Interrelated Properties:
* Molecular structure → physical-chemical properties (solubility, vapor pressure) → environmental distribution & transformation → biological effects.
* Predictive Models: Partition coefficients, molecular surface area, and lab measurements now predict environmental fate & toxicity effectively.

* 1.7 Key Points Summary
* Alchemy → early applied chemistry; mystical focus on metal transmutation.
* Lavoisier → atmospheric chemistry foundations (oxygen, CO₂ cycles).
* Perkin → synthetic dyes → modern chemical industry origins.
* Haber → ammonia synthesis → fertilizers → population growth.
* “Environmental chemistry” term modern; concepts date back centuries.
* Studies sources, fate, reactions, and impacts of chemicals in environment.
* Modern theory explains distribution, transformation, and effects.
* Supports emissions control, worker safety, chemical regulation.
* Molecular properties link to environmental distribution and toxicity models.
