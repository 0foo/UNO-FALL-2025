### Environmental Chemistry
    * Environmental Chemistry is defined as the study of chemical reactions in terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric environments, and the human impact on these processes.
    * It encompasses various sub-fields like astrochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, environmental modeling, geochemistry, marine chemistry, and pollution remediation.
    * Some of the applications of environmental chemistry are:
        * Assessing chemical risks for environmental safety.
        * Researching the impact of new products on the environment.
        * Protecting groundwater from contamination.
    * Environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary field incorporating knowledge from mathematics, geology, biology, ecology, 
        * toxicology: study of adverse effects of chemical on organisms, and 
        * hydrology: study of water
        * to study the influence of chemicals on the natural environment.

### Formation of the Earth  
    * The Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a cloud of dust and gas left behind by earlier stars.  
    * Gravity pulled together hydrogen and helium to form stars. Inside stars, nuclear fusion produced elements up to iron.  
    * Heavier elements were created during supernova explosions of massive stars, scattering materials across space.  
    * Our solar system, including the Sun, Earth, and planets, formed from this stardust.  

* Early Earth and Moon Formation  
    * The early Earth was extremely hot due to impacts from forming debris and gravitational compression.  
    * A collision between the early Earth and another planet likely produced the Moon.  
        * Evidence: Similar age and rock composition between Earth and Moon.  

* Internal Structure of the Earth  
    * **Inner Core:**  
        * Solid iron-nickel alloy.  
        * Extremely hot (~5,700°C), but high pressure keeps it solid.  
    * **Outer Core:**  
        * Molten iron-nickel layer surrounding the inner core.  
        * Movement of liquid metal creates Earth’s magnetic field (geodynamo).  
    * **Mantle:**  
        * Solid but behaves plastically, meaning it can flow very slowly over millions of years.  
        * Composed mainly of aluminum- and magnesium-rich silicate rocks.  
        * Convection currents in the mantle drive plate tectonics and continental drift.  
    * **Crust:**  
        * Outer solid layer of the Earth, made of two main types of rock:  
            * Basalt: Denser, magnesium- and iron-rich, forming the oceanic crust.  
            * Granite: Less dense, aluminum- and silica-rich, forming the continents.  
        * Continents “float” on the denser mantle below, like icebergs in water.  

* Oceans and Atmosphere Formation  
    * Early atmosphere formed from volcanic gases: mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.  
    * Initially no oxygen until photosynthetic life evolved billions of years later.  
    * As Earth cooled:  
        * Water vapor condensed to form oceans.  
        * Rain dissolved minerals from rocks, carrying salts to the oceans and making them salty.  

* Evidence for Earth's Structure and Age  
    * Seismic Waves: 
        * Earthquakes produce two main types:  
            * P-waves (primary, compressional) travel through solids and liquids.  
            * S-waves (secondary, shear) travel only through solids.  
        * Tracking how these waves move through Earth reveals interior layers based on speed and behavior.  
    * Radioactive Dating: 
        * Certain isotopes, such as potassium-40, decay over known half-lives.  
        * Measuring parent vs. daughter isotopes (e.g., potassium-40 → argon-40) gives the age of rock solidification.  
        * Example: Equal amounts of potassium-40 and argon-40 mean the rock solidified one half-life ago (~100 million years).  

* Summary  
    * Earth consists of:  
        * A solid inner and liquid outer iron core.  
        * A solid but slowly flowing mantle.  
        * A thin, solid crust forming continents and ocean basins.  
        * Liquid oceans and a gaseous atmosphere at the surface.  
    * These layers formed as Earth cooled, differentiated by density, and evolved over billions of years.  


### Continental drift
* Alfred Wegener's Theory of Continental Drift  
    * Proposed in 1912 by Alfred Wegener.  
    * Suggested that all continents were once part of a single supercontinent called Pangaea.  
    * Over millions of years, Pangaea broke apart, and the continents slowly drifted to their current positions.  

* Early Evidence for the Theory  
    * Continents fit together like puzzle pieces (e.g., South America and Africa coastlines).  
    * Similar fossil-bearing rock layers found across continents now separated by oceans.  
    * Matching geological features, such as mountain ranges, continued across continents.  

* Initial Rejection  
    * Wegener could not explain *how* the continents moved.  
    * Without a mechanism, his theory was dismissed by much of the scientific community until the mid-20th century.  

* Development of Plate Tectonics (1965)  
    * The theory of plate tectonics provided the missing mechanism:  
        * The Earth's lithosphere (crust + rigid upper mantle) is divided into large tectonic plates.  
        * Plates float on the ductile, slowly flowing asthenosphere beneath.  
        * Convection currents in the mantle drive plate motion.  

* Magnetic Evidence from the Ocean Floor  
    * At mid-ocean ridges, molten rock rises and solidifies, preserving the direction of Earth's magnetic field at the time.  
    * Earth's magnetic field reverses every few million years (magnetic north and south swap places).  
    * This creates symmetrical stripes of normal and reversed polarity on either side of mid-ocean ridges.  
    * The pattern shows new crust forming and spreading outward, proving seafloor spreading.  

* Earthquakes, Volcanoes, and Mountain Ranges  
    * Mapping earthquake and volcano locations shows they align along tectonic plate boundaries.  
    * Different types of boundaries explain geological features:  
        * Divergent boundaries: Plates move apart (e.g., mid-ocean ridges).  
        * Convergent boundaries: Plates collide, forming mountains or volcanic arcs.  
            * Example: Himalayas form as India collides with Asia.  
            * Example: Pacific Plate subducting beneath Asia creates Japan’s islands, earthquakes, volcanoes, and deep ocean trenches.  
        * Transform boundaries: Plates slide past each other, causing earthquakes (e.g., San Andreas Fault).  

* Key Outcomes  
    * Continental drift and plate tectonics together explain:  
        * Distribution of continents and oceans.  
        * Patterns of earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain ranges.  
        * Formation of new crust at ridges and destruction at subduction zones.  

  
### Plate TEctonics
* Plate Tectonics and Continental Drift  
    * The theory of plate tectonics explains how continents drift and why mountains, earthquakes, and volcanoes form.  
    * The Earth's thin, solid crust lies above a solid but slowly flowing mantle.  
    * Convection currents in the mantle move tectonic plates across Earth's surface.  

* Convection Currents and Plate Motion  
    * Cooler, denser mantle rock sinks toward the core, while hotter, less dense rock rises toward the surface.  
    * These currents divide the lithosphere into large plates that carry continents and ocean basins along with them.  
    * Continental crust is lighter than oceanic crust, so it “rides” on the plates like rafts.  

* Divergent Boundaries (Plates Move Apart)  
    * Where convection currents rise, plates pull apart.  
    * Magma rises to fill the gap, forming new oceanic crust made of basaltic igneous rock.  
    * Example: The Mid-Atlantic Ridge where Europe and North America drift apart.  
        * Started as a rift valley, later flooded with seawater to form the Atlantic Ocean.  
        * Spreading continues today at a rate similar to fingernail growth (~2–5 cm per year).  
    * Underwater volcanoes and unique ecosystems (e.g., black smokers) form along these ridges.  

* Convergent Boundaries (Plates Move Together)  
    * When plates collide, one plate may be forced downward (subduction).  
        * Oceanic crust subducts under continental crust due to higher density.  
        * Sediments and crustal material melt, forming volcanic arcs and mountain ranges.  
        * Example: Andes Mountains in South America, Cascades in North America.  
    * Continental collisions form huge mountain ranges.  
        * Example: Himalayas formed as India collided with Asia.  

* Transform Boundaries (Plates Slide Past Each Other)  
    * Plates move horizontally past one another.  
    * Friction causes earthquakes along faults.  
        * Example: San Andreas Fault in California.  
        * Over millions of years, Los Angeles will move northward alongside San Francisco.  

* Hot Spots (Volcano Chains Away from Boundaries)  
    * A single mantle plume creates a fixed hot spot beneath a moving plate.  
    * As the plate moves, a chain of volcanic islands forms.  
        * Example: Hawaiian Islands, with older islands eroding as new ones form.  

* Crustal Recycling  
    * Oceanic crust is young (less than a few hundred million years old).  
        * Constantly created at mid-ocean ridges and destroyed at subduction zones.  
    * Continental crust is much older and has persisted since Earth’s early history.  
        * It is broken apart and recombined through plate movements over billions of years.  

* Plate Movements Over Time  
    * 250 million years ago: All continents were joined in Pangaea.  
    * Over time: Plate movements broke Pangaea apart.  
    * 65 million years ago: The Atlantic Ocean widened; India collided with Asia.  
    * Present day: Continents continue drifting, shaping Earth’s surface.  

### Chemical equations
* Chemical Equations Overview  
    * A chemical equation shows the overall chemical change where reactants form products.  
    * It is like a detailed recipe listing all starting materials (reactants) and all products, even those not visible in the final mixture.  

* Ways to Write Chemical Equations  
    * **Word Equations**  
        * Show reactants and products using names.  
        * Example: sodium hydroxide + hydrochloric acid → sodium chloride + water  
        * Reactants on the left of the arrow; products on the right.  
        * The plus sign (+) separates multiple reactants or products.  
        * Keeping the equation on one line makes it easier to read; if split across lines, the arrow marks the separation clearly.  
    * **Symbol Equations**  
        * Use chemical formulas instead of names.  
        * Example: NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H₂O  
        * Provide more detail, including atom counts and states of matter.  
        * State symbols in brackets indicate physical states:  
            * (s) solid  
            * (l) liquid  
            * (g) gas  
            * (aq) aqueous (dissolved in water)  

* Reaction Direction and Reversibility  
    * A single arrow (→) means the reaction is irreversible; it goes in one direction only.  
    * Two half-arrows in opposite directions (⇌) indicate a reversible reaction.  
        * Conditions like pressure, temperature, or concentration can shift the reaction forward or backward.  
        * Example: Ammonia formation (N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃) is reversible and reaches equilibrium under certain conditions.  

* Balancing Chemical Equations  
    * Numbers in front of formulas (coefficients) ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides.  
    * Example: N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃ shows two molecules of ammonia form from one nitrogen and three hydrogen molecules.  
    * Balancing maintains the law of conservation of mass.  

* Key Points to Remember  
    * Reactants on the left; products on the right.  
    * Single arrow = irreversible reaction.  
    * Double arrow = reversible reaction.  
    * Word equations show the reaction simply; symbol equations give more detail, including atom counts and states.  
    * Balancing ensures mass is conserved in the equation.  


### Rock Cycle
* The Dynamic Rock Cycle  
    * The Earth’s surface is constantly changing as rocks form, break down, and reform over millions of years.  
    * The rock cycle links igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks through processes like weathering, erosion, heat, pressure, and melting.  

* Formation of Soils and Sediments  
    * A jar of soil shaken with water separates into layers:  
        * Sand and small stones settle at the bottom.  
        * Clay forms a middle layer.  
        * Organic matter (humus) floats on top.  
    * Plant roots help break solid rock into soil while drawing nutrients from it.  

* Igneous and Sedimentary Rocks  
    * **Granite**  
        * Forms when molten rock (magma) cools and solidifies underground.  
        * Has interlocking grains, making it dense and impermeable (no air spaces).  
    * **Sandstone**  
        * Forms from sand grains deposited by rivers and seas.  
        * Has rounded grains with air spaces, making it porous and able to hold water.  

* Weathering Processes  
    * **Mechanical Weathering**  
        * collision, erosion, water freezing in cracks, impact, expand/contract due to temp
        * Temperature changes cause expansion and contraction, cracking rocks.  
        * Water freezes in cracks, widening them further (freeze–thaw action).  
        * Wind and moving water cause rocks to collide, breaking them apart.  
    * **Chemical Weathering**  
        * dissolve
        * Rainwater (slightly acidic) dissolves minerals like feldspar.  
    * **Biological Weathering**  
        * Roots and plants grow in cracks, splitting rocks apart.  
        * Lichens and mosses release weak acids that slowly dissolve rock surfaces.  

* Erosion and Transport  
    * Weathered material is moved by wind, rivers, glaciers, or oceans.  
    * Heavier minerals like quartz settle quickly as sand; lighter materials form clay.  
    * Clay retains trace metals essential for plant growth.  

* Metamorphic Rock Formation  
    * Rocks buried under heat and pressure change form (metamorphosis).  
    * Examples:  
        * Sandstone → Quartzite  
        * Clay → Shale → Slate  
        * Limestone → Marble  
    * Coal forms from plant matter (peat) compressed over millions of years.  

* Role of Plate Tectonics  
    * Rocks are carried deep into the Earth by subduction at plate boundaries.  
    * Intense heat in the mantle melts them into magma, restarting the rock cycle.  

* Full Rock Cycle Summary  
    * Molten rock cools → Igneous rocks form (e.g., granite, basalt).  
    * Weathering and erosion → Sedimentary rocks form (e.g., sandstone, limestone).  
    * Heat and pressure → Metamorphic rocks form (e.g., slate, marble).  
    * Subduction and melting → Magma → Igneous rocks again, continuing the cycle.  

### Limestone cycle
* Limestone and the Limestone Cycle  
    * Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).  
    * Formed millions of years ago from the compressed shells and skeletons of dead marine organisms deposited on the seabed.  
    * Used historically in buildings, statues, and other structures.  

* Thermal Decomposition of Limestone  
    * Heating limestone (CaCO₃) in a rotary kiln produces quicklime (CaO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).  
        * Reaction: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂  
    * This is an **endothermic reaction** because it requires heat input.  
    * The rotating kiln ensures the limestone is heated evenly and completely decomposed.  

* Formation of Slaked Lime  
    * Quicklime reacts vigorously with water in an **exothermic reaction** to produce slaked lime (Ca(OH)₂).  
        * Reaction: CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂  
    * This process is called *slaking*.  
    * Slaked lime is only slightly soluble in water, so large amounts of water are needed to make lime water.  

* Formation of Lime Water  
    * Dissolving slaked lime in water produces lime water, an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂).  
    * Lime water is used to test for carbon dioxide.  

* Completing the Limestone Cycle   
    * Passing carbon dioxide into lime water produces calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), turning the solution milky because CaCO₃ is insoluble.  
        * Reaction: Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O  
    * If CO₂ continues to bubble through, calcium hydrogen carbonate [Ca(HCO₃)₂] forms, turning the solution clear again because it is soluble.  
        * Reaction: CaCO₃ + CO₂ + H₂O → Ca(HCO₃)₂  

* Summary of the Cycle  
    * Limestone (CaCO₃) → heated → Quicklime (CaO) → water added → Slaked Lime (Ca(OH)₂) → dissolved → Lime Water → CO₂ added → Calcium Carbonate (CaCO₃) again.  
    * The cycle shows how heat, water, and carbon dioxide transform limestone through various chemical reactions.  

### USes of limestone
* Uses of Limestone Overview  
    * Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).  
    * It is the starting material for producing:  
        * Quicklime (CaO) through thermal decomposition.  
        * Slaked lime (Ca(OH)₂) when quicklime reacts with water.  
    * Beyond these products, limestone has many real-world applications in construction, industry, and environmental management.  

* Building and Construction Uses  
    * Historical structures built with limestone include:  
        * Empire State Building (New York, USA)  
        * St. Paul’s Cathedral (London, UK)  
        * Houses of Parliament (London, UK)  
        * Great Pyramid of Giza (Egypt)  
        * Walls of Machu Picchu (Peru)  
    * Limestone has been used for centuries as a durable, carvable building material.  

* Environmental Issues: Acid Rain  
    * Acid rain contains carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) and other acids.  
    * Calcium carbonate reacts with carbonic acid to form calcium hydrogen carbonate [Ca(HCO₃)₂], which is soluble in water.  
    * This reaction slowly erodes limestone buildings and monuments.  
        * Reaction: CaCO₃ + H₂CO₃ → Ca(HCO₃)₂  

* Production of Building Materials  
    * **Cement**: Made by heating limestone with clay in a rotary kiln.  
    * **Mortar**: Cement mixed with sand and water; used to glue bricks together.  
    * **Concrete**: Cement mixed with sand, gravel, and water; reinforced concrete includes steel bars for added strength.  
    * **Aggregates**: Crushed limestone used for road construction and paving.  

* Glass Production  
    * Heating limestone with sand (SiO₂) and sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) produces certain types of glass.  

* Environmental Applications  
    * **Neutralizing Acidic Soils and Water (Liming)**  
        * Crushed limestone is added to acidic lakes, rivers, or soil to raise pH.  
        * Reaction with acids: CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + CO₂ + H₂O  

* Hard Water and Limescale  
    * Hard water contains dissolved calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions.  
    * When these ions combine with carbonate (CO₃²⁻), insoluble calcium carbonate forms as limescale.  
    * Seen as white deposits in kettles, pipes, and around faucets.  

* Other Uses  
    * Ground limestone (white powder) is used as a filler or coloring agent in paints, plastics, and toothpaste.  

* Summary of Limestone Uses  
    * Building material for structures and monuments.  
    * Production of cement, mortar, concrete, and aggregates.  
    * Glass manufacturing.  
    * Neutralizing acidic environments (liming).  
    * Source of lime products (quicklime, slaked lime).  
    * Additive in paints, plastics, and toothpaste.  
    * Role in hard water and limescale formation.  

### Chemistry of Quarrying
* Limestone Quarrying Overview  
    * Limestone forms from compressed shells and skeletons of marine organisms.  
    * It must be mined from open-pit mines called quarries.  
    * Quarrying provides raw materials for construction, cement production, and many industrial uses.  

* Economic Benefits  
    * Creates jobs for local workers in quarrying, transport, and processing industries.  
    * Supports local and national economies through construction and infrastructure projects.  
    * Provides affordable building materials for homes, schools, and industries.  

* Social Effects  
    * New jobs attract workers and their families, increasing local housing needs and schools.  
    * Can bring economic growth but also changes the character of rural areas.  
    * Once a quarry closes, workers may lose jobs, and communities may decline if no alternative employment exists.  

* Environmental Impacts  
    * Quarries are visually disruptive, scarring the landscape.  
    * Noise from blasting, drilling, and transport affects nearby residents.  
    * Dust from quarrying can reduce air quality and harm health.  
    * Habitat destruction removes plants, animals, and ecosystems.  
    * Truck transport increases noise, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.  

* Land Use Changes  
    * When quarrying ends, large pits remain with no immediate use.  
    * Abandoned sites can become unsafe, unattractive, or economically unproductive.  

* Minimizing Negative Effects  
    * Careful planning can reduce impacts:  
        * Limit quarry size to preserve scenery.  
        * Reduce frequency of blasting and truck transport.  
        * Replant trees and restore habitats after quarrying ends.  
        * Convert old quarries into parks, tourist attractions, or educational sites.  

* Balancing Advantages and Disadvantages  
    * Advantages: Job creation, economic growth, raw materials for construction and industry.  
    * Disadvantages: Landscape damage, noise, air pollution, habitat loss, and community disruption.  
    * Sustainable quarrying practices help balance economic needs with environmental protection.  

### Chemistry of minerals and ores
* Minerals and Ores Overview  
    * Minerals are naturally occurring elements or compounds found in the Earth’s crust.  
    * An ore is a rock containing a high enough percentage of a particular mineral to make extraction economically worthwhile.  
    * Examples of ores:  
        * Hematite (iron ore) → high in iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃).  
        * Malachite (copper ore) → high in copper(II) carbonate (CuCO₃).  
        * Cinnabar (mercury ore) → high in mercury(II) sulfide (HgS).  
        * Limestone → high in calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).  

* Mineral Composition  
    * Most ores contain metals combined as:  
        * Oxides (e.g., Fe₂O₃ in hematite)  
        * Carbonates (e.g., CuCO₃ in malachite)  
        * Sulfides (e.g., HgS in cinnabar)  
    * Some nonmetal ores exist too, e.g., quartz (SiO₂) for silicon.  

* Economic Considerations  
    * The higher the concentration of the mineral in the ore, the cheaper and easier it is to extract.  
    * Ores with low mineral content require more energy and cost for extraction, making them less economical.  

* Reactivity and Extraction Methods  
    * The reactivity series ranks elements from most to least reactive.  
    * A more reactive element can displace a less reactive element from its compound in a **single displacement reaction**.  
        * Example: Carbon (C) displaces copper (Cu) from copper(II) oxide (CuO).  
    * Highly reactive metals (e.g., aluminum, sodium) require electrolysis for extraction; less reactive ones (e.g., iron, copper) use displacement reactions.  

* Example: Extracting Copper from Malachite  
    * Malachite (CuCO₃) thermally decomposes into copper(II) oxide (CuO) and CO₂ when heated:  
        * CuCO₃ → CuO + CO₂  
    * Carbon (as charcoal) displaces copper from CuO when strongly heated:  
        * CuO + C → Cu + CO₂  
    * Result: Copper metal collects at the bottom after washing away excess charcoal.  

* Native Metals  
    * Metals like gold (Au) and platinum (Pt) occur naturally in metallic form.  
    * They are very low in the reactivity series, so they do not combine with oxygen, sulfur, or carbon in the crust.  

* Summary  
    * Ore = rock with a high percentage of mineral.  * Examples of ores:  
    * Hematite (iron ore) → high in iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃).  
    * Malachite (copper ore) → high in copper(II) carbonate (CuCO₃).  
    * Cinnabar (mercury ore) → high in mercury(II) sulfide (HgS).  
    * Limestone → high in calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).  
    * Extraction method depends on metal reactivity:  
        * More reactive → electrolysis.  
        * Less reactive → displacement with carbon or other reducing agents.  
    * Economic value depends on mineral concentration and energy cost of extraction.  

### Future extraction methods
* Copper and Its Extraction Challenges  
    * Copper is widely used in pipes, wiring, electronics, shipbuilding, and roofing.  
    * Pure copper metal is rarely found naturally; it mostly occurs in ores containing copper and other minerals.  
    * High-grade ores contain large amounts of copper; low-grade ores contain less than 1% copper.  
    * Due to centuries of mining, high-grade ores are running out, so low-grade ores must be used.  

* Bioleaching  
    * Bioleaching uses bacteria to extract copper from low-grade ores.  
    * Certain bacteria break weak chemical bonds between copper and sulfur in the ore.  
        * This releases copper ions into solution as the bacteria gain energy from the reaction.  
    * Advantages:  
        * Very energy-efficient compared to smelting or electrolysis.  
        * Reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  
    * Disadvantages:  
        * Very slow process, taking months or years to produce significant copper.  

* Phytomining  
    * Involves growing plants on soil containing low-grade copper ores.  
    * Plants absorb copper compounds through their roots and store them in their tissues.  
    * Harvested plants are burned to produce ash containing copper oxides.  
        * Burning removes carbon and hydrogen as CO₂ and H₂O, leaving metal oxides behind.  
    * Advantages:  
        * Can clean up contaminated land while producing copper.  
        * Useful for low-concentration ores where traditional mining is uneconomical.  
    * Disadvantages:  
        * Copper in the ash is impure and requires further processing by electrolysis.  
        * Still less efficient than direct extraction from high-grade ores.  

* Comparison of Methods  
    * Bioleaching → energy-efficient, low pollution, but very slow.  
    * Phytomining → cheap, environmentally friendly, but produces impure copper.  
    * Both methods help address declining supplies of high-grade copper ore.
